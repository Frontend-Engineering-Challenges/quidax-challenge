# Quidax Front-end Engineer Skill Assessment 

The task was to mplement a dashboard view for the fictional Quidax Book Club web application, exactly as detailed in the UI mockups provided using HTML, CSS/SCSS, vanilla Javascript, and ​only​ the suggested libraries/plugins for certain UI elements. 

## Instructions  
To run the project;
1. open your terminal and navigate to `/quidax-challenge"`
2. run `npm install` in your terminal to download dependencies
3. run `npm run build` in your terminal to transpile and bundle scss and javascript files respectively
4. run `npm start` in your terminal to start up live server
5. open your browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8080`


## Assumptions
- For the search autocomplete, I assumed that the search results were to be filtered from the first letter of the book title instead of anywhere the search term appears in the title.
- Based on the UI design, I assumed that matched search terms in the search results is highlighted as the user types.
- When the search terms have no match,a message is displayed to show the user that there are no results.


## Constructive feedback
It was a beautiful challenge. I liked the little `gotchas` that was waiting at every turn. An example is the initials behind the profile picture. My favourite part was trying to spot the little details.
